### LSTM  

v6 -> distance between adjacent fingers were calculated and used as the vector

v7 -> balanced dataset

### SVM

v1 - distance from the fingertip of each finger to the palm is taken as the vector (dataset v1)

v2 - distance from the fingertip of each finger to the palm is taken as the vector (dataset v2)
